# AI and Risk Management — BetterFit (Mini Case Study)

## Overview
This mini-project demonstrates how AI-driven applications can be assessed for governance and risk. It focuses on ethical, technical, and compliance risks — including model bias, data privacy, explainability, and reliability — and maps them to standard frameworks such as ISO 31000, ISO 27001, GDPR, and the NIST AI RMF.

## Context
The assessment is based on a sample AI application named **BetterFit**, which recommends personalized diet plans using user inputs and image analysis. The project highlights realistic risks, produces a structured risk register, and proposes mitigation controls that align with IT Risk, GRC, or Advisory practices.

## Deliverables
- **BetterFit_AI_Risk_Assessment.pdf** — Full written case study with analysis and recommendations
- **Risk_Register.xlsx** — Detailed risk register with scoring, ownership, and control actions
- **visuals/** — Risk matrix and system data-flow diagram (for interview/portfolio use)

## How to Use This Repository
1. Start with the PDF for the narrative and framework alignment.
2. Review `Risk_Register.xlsx` for structured scoring and mitigation approach.
3. Use the visuals folder for presentation, slides, or interview explanations.
